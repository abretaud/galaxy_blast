Make a FASTA file non-redundant, with a Galaxy wrapper
======================================================

This tool is copyright 2018 by Peter Cock, The James Hutton Institute, UK.
All rights reserved. See the licence text below.

This tool is a short Python script intended to be run prior to calling
the NCBI BLAST+ command line tool ``makeblastdb`` or in other settings
where you want to collapse duplicated sequences in a FASTA file to a
single representative.

The script ``make_nr.py`` can be used directly (without Galaxy).
It requires Biopython.

It comes with an optional Galaxy tool definition file ``make_nr.xml``
allowing the Python script to be run from within Galaxy. It is available
from the Galaxy Tool Shed at:
http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc/make_nr

Standalone Installation (outside Galaxy)
========================================

Outside of Galaxy, you will need Python and Biopython, the later can usually
be installed with ``pip install biopython`` or if you are using Conda, try
``conda install biopython`` instead. Then to run the script, simply call it
using ``python /full/path/to/make_nr.py -h`` or similar.


Automated Installation
======================

Installation via the Galaxy Tool Shed should take care of the Galaxy side of
things, including the dependency on Biopython.


Manual Installation
===================

There are just two files to install:

- ``make_nr.py`` (the Python script)
- ``make_nr.xml`` (the Galaxy tool definition)

The suggested location is in a ``tools/make_nr/`` folder. You will then
need to modify the ``tools_conf.xml`` file to tell Galaxy to offer the tool
by adding the line::

    <tool file="make_nr/make_nr.xml" />

If you want to run the functional tests, copy the sample test files under
sample test files under Galaxy's ``test-data/`` directory. Then::

    ./run_tests.sh -id make_nr


History
=======

TODO:

 - Option to follow BLAST NR style with ctrl+a separator?
 - Option to give representative sequences in upper case?

Developers
==========

This tool is developed on the following GitHub repository:
https://github.com/peterjc/galaxy_blast/tree/master/tools/make_nr

For pushing a release to the test or main "Galaxy Tool Shed", use the following
Planemo commands (which requires you have set your Tool Shed access details in
``~/.planemo.yml`` and that you have access rights on the Tool Shed)::

    $ planemo shed_update -t testtoolshed --check_diff tools/make_nr/
    ...

or::

    $ planemo shed_update -t toolshed --check_diff tools/make_nr/
    ...

To just build and check the tar ball, use::

    $ planemo shed_upload --tar_only tools/make_nr/
    ...
    $ tar -tzf shed_upload.tar.gz
    tools/make_nr/README.rst
    tools/make_nr/make_nr.py
    tools/make_nr/make_nr.xml
